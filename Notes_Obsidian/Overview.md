# Questions to be answered


**Enhancing Spatial Orientation and Design Decisions in Urban Development by Integrating Game-inspired Orientation Tools**
## Problem

 archive
	For the project "Creating NEBourhoods", new methods and innovative solutions to transform existing urban spaces are being tested. The project aims to re-establish connections between people, building, public spaces and nature in developing a system for participatory development of multifunctional mobility centres. 
	But for the local community to participate in the design process and make well informed decisions, necessary information about the urban space in question needs to be available. 
	Immersive virtual environments allow for more accurate perception of spatial properties [1] and a significantly better understanding of potential architectural designs [2].  However, in order for the user to understand the given space and to to give them spatial orientation of the whole neighbourhood, in which the design is situated, more information than that of a small area might be necessary. Furthermore information about existing trades, offices and leisure activities available nearby, might be necessary to give the local community the feeling that they are now able to make good design choices regarding the development of the multifunctional mobility centre in their neighbourhood.
	The goal of this research is to find a design solution so the user is able to gain an understanding of the space and what it needs,  and in doing so having the feeling to be able to make well informed design decisions. 


Immersive virtual environments allow for more accurate perception of spatial properties [1] and a significantly better understanding of potential architectural designs [2]. However, the information that makes up the spirit of place, the genius loci, involves more then physical and environmental aspects of an environment [3]. It is a concept that also involves psychological, social, economical and historical characteristics which play an important role when designing for urban planning [4]. 
So in order for the user to truly understand the given space and to discern its needs, more information might be necessary. 

The goal of this research is to find a design solution so the user is able to gain understanding of a place and what it needs and use that knowledge to make design decisions for urban planning regarding urban design interventions.

## Hypotheses 
**Adding markers and orientation systems inspired by video games will lead to a better spatial orientation and understanding of the area therefore improve the communication of the information necessary to be able to make design decisions for a multifunctional mobility centre.**

Integrating map-based systems, markers, and game-inspired navigation tools within a virtual environment, along with comprehensive spatial information about the neighborhood, will significantly enhance the user's spatial orientation, understanding, and ability to make well-informed design decisions for the development of multifunctional mobility centers compared to an immersive virtual environment using only a map-based approach.





## Ansatz 

→ first a literature research will be conducted on potential design solutions for the the virtual environment. spatial information and how to bring the identity of the place across.

design choices will be divided into two types of information
	Atmospheric → light & shadow, sounds, population
	Informative → trades, offices, leisure activities  

→ chosen design solutions will be implemented into a virtual reality environment

→ in a user study participants will then be introduced to both design solutions



→ validated questionnaire-based self-estimate of orientation/navigation ability -  Cognitive Mapping

→ recall specific details or locations within that layout after a delay - Spatial Recall Test
	like asking - what kind of shops are there, rate them from close to far away
  

→ ability to make design decisions - Self-Efficacy Scale 










# Ideas

### Adding information to make decisions

aber um feeling für neighbourhood zu kriegen um anschließend entscheidungen für das Design einer mobilitätsstation zu treffen werden additional information gebraucht. The goal of this research is to find a design solution on how to incorporate this information into the virtual experience so the user is able to orient themselfs 

to give the usera feel of the area and the feeling that they have enough information to make decisions. 


what information need to be incoporated for the user to feel like they can make a good decision
