Signal Detection Theory can provide deeper insights into not just whether participants got the answers right, but how they made those decisions. It helps you understand their ability to discern the correct answers from distractors and whether they exhibit any biases in their decision-making process. This can be especially useful in contexts where the recall task involves distinguishing subtle differences between options or when analyzing tendencies in response behavior.

Not only has it been heavily present in memory research dating all the way back to the 1970s, but it’s also present in work with individuals with ADHD, accuracy in radiology diagnostics, and more.
	
To put it as simply as possible, [in psychology, signal detection theory](https://study.com/academy/lesson/signal-detection-theory-definition-examples.html) relates to the idea that the intensity of the stimuli and the psychological and physical state of the person contribute to whether or not the person is able to detect the stimuli.
	
A number of studies have been done on SDT within the context of decision-making over the years
	
Whether you’re conducting research into memory, the characteristics of certain stimuli, or how reinforcement occurs
	
Psychologists, generally speaking, use signal detection theory when they are attempting to measure how we make decisions when faced with at least some degree of uncertainty.

Signal detection theory (SDT) plays a central role in the characterization of human judgments in a wide range of domains, most prominently in recognition memory

Multiple-choice (MC) exams can be viewed as being a signal detection task, in that examinees attempt to select the correct alternative (the signal) out of a set that includes incorrect alternatives (noise). From a psychological perspective, examinees are viewed as basing their decisions on their _perceptions_ of the alternatives, with the perceptions in turn being levels of _perceived plausibility_ for each alternative. The _decision process_ is to select the most plausible alternative out of the set of alternatives. It is also assumed that examinees either “know” or do not know each item. It is shown here that these assumptions together lead to a signal detection model for multiple choice exams. The approach offers information about the relative plausibility of each alternative as well as measures of item discrimination and difficulty
	
the SDT model detects possibly problematical items that are missed by an analysis using the nominal response model, the 2PL or 3PL models, or simple inspection of response proportions
	
Another advantage is that the interpretation of the results in terms of SDT is simple and straightforward, which is important for practitioners.

This dual-process signal-detection/high-threshold theory (henceforth referred to as the DPSD model) has had wide influence, not only in the field of psychology but also in the field of cognitive neuroscience, where results from brain lesion studies and neuroimaging studies are often interpreted in terms of its assumptions
	
The DPSD model is an elegant, parsimonious, and internally consistent attempt to bring together the dual-process theory of recognition memory and signaldetection theory
