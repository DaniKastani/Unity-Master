study of place benefits from an interdisciplinary approach - interdisciplinary research in art, humanities and social science

Place is a way of understanding the world

Place is also a way of seeing, knowing and understandig the world

certain spaces stand out within the greater Space in which people circulate and, by standing out, are perceived differently. These are generally spaces perceived to contain certain qualities. Thus it can be said that these spaces are perceived as places by their users.
they allow a place to be distinguished from a space

Edward Relph (1976) - the significance of place, although anchored into physical configurations and activities, is not the property of these features, but rather of the intentions and experience of the people who occupy them

It can therefore be stated that place is a qualified space, or rather a space that comes to be perceived by the population through the motivation of human experiences based on the apprehension of environmental stimuli - how a place may come about. A place may therefore come about in the following ways.
- through narrative, reputation, natural assets, historic building, association with political actions, local traditions, emotive connotations, construction of a fantasy, available sensory enjoyment and comfort but also availability of goods, services or technological facilities

It can therefore be said that the perception of a place may for example occur through apprehension of socio-cultural stimuli (which would cover such sections as narrative, history, tradition); or morphologicalimaginary stimuli (natural assets, beauty, reputation, representation of fantasy, among others) or finally, enjoyment-functional stimuli (services, utilities, sensory enjoyment, comfort, pleasure).
-but all resulting from the interaction between people and environment.

The ‘spirit of place’ is in fact a concept from ancient Rome which came to great prominence in the literature of modern architecture-urbanism following the detailed and poetic approach of the Norwegian architect Christian Norberg-Scultz (1980) in his famous work Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture

places refer to areas laden with meaning and memory. 
space is also used freely as the general idea of surroundings, used in the sense on how do people experience  their surroundings?

While constantly changing, sense of place often appears to be fixed. This complex phenomenon results from myriad interacting factors—situational, historical, cultural, political, environmental, personal, and social, among others. 
Sense of place does not describe only a physical reality—rather it represents belief in the spirit of a locale, the living force that makes “undifferentiated space [become] place as we get to know it better and endow it with value” (Tuan, 1977, p. 6)

“Place” as a concept has been explored within a variety of disciplines as diverse as geography (Harvey, 1996; Massey, 1994), cultural anthropology (Altman & Low, 1992), architecture (Galliano & Loeffler, 1999; Hayden, 1997), leisure studies (Bricker & Kerstetter, 2000), and forest science (Cheng & Daniels, 2003; Williams & Vaske, 2003) to name a few. Additionally, as the internet becomes more prominent in the daily lives of so many people, explorations of emerging areas such as educational technology, communities of practice, and virtual places are also on the rise.1 Each field of study seeks to understand how people relate to places and what connection to place means

Through an extensive interdisciplinary literature review and preliminary field-based research, four consistent dimensions of “sense of place” have emerged: the biophysical environment; the personal/psychological element; the social and cultural context; and the political economic milieu.
