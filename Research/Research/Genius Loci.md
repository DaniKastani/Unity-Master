It is significant in terms of being both the mediator and medium of social interactions.


Places are characterised by different relationships that are of 
- economic
- cultural
- psychic
- social - zwischenmenschliche interaction 
- and emotional importance

Places are spaces of 
- social aggregation
- of communication
- of community
- and of multiple values, including 
		- historic, 
		- artistic, 
		- cultural 
		- and social ones. 

They become fundamental elements for the resilience capacity of a place and its genius loci. 

Genius loci is an *intangible character* of a material site, yet also includes its *physical properties*.
As we have proposed, genius loci is a meta-concept, it is made of different layers 
	-- the visible and tangible material layer
	-- the invisible experience of the place created in the human mind
	-- and the underlying processes of human and natural activity with all interrelations between   them



“environmental character”  is the essence of the place. 
In general, the place is defined by its character or “atmosphere”. 
While space indicates the three-dimensional organisation of the elements that make up the place, the ‘character’ denotes the general ‘*atmosphere*’, which represents the most comprehensive property of any place.

**Tangible** but especially the **intangible dimension** is fundamental in the denotation of the place. The place can be defined as a concrete entity that is at the same time intangible, with a multidimensional character based on 
- geographical, 
- historical, 
- cultural, 
- architectural, 
- economic 
- and social coherence.

Whether in relation to tangible or intangible forms in a place, genius loci creates an environmental character via an overall atmosphere and then leads the relationship between this and the community. 

Genius loci should be understood in reference to human perception and sensation. 
This perception is rooted in our **physical and emotional experiences** and **pre-conceived knowledge**, adopting Gadamer’s hermeneutic perspective. 
	Casey [16] agrees that **place must be experienced**: “there is no knowing or sensing a place except by being in that place, and to be in a place is to be in a position to perceive it” (1996: 18). 
It follows that genius loci can be assumed as a reality and an entity [2]. In this vein, Hillmann [18] states that places are **emotional identities**, having a soul. Our task is to discover it, just as we would get to know another human.


The genius loci as a meta-concept is based on the assumption that it is made of **different layers**, and that **each layer brings a dimension of significance**, holistically speaking [42]. 
It includes and refers to 
		biological
		social
		environmental
		physical 
		and human dimensions. 
The following are of note: 
• the visible and tangible material layer; 
• the invisible experience of the place created in the human mind; 
• and the underlying processes of human and natural activity with all interrelations between them.

In this context, the 
	socio-economic, 
	cultural dynamics 
	and natural processes 
can be identified as the main underlying factors. 
Values and preferences represent the intangible layer while the appearance of the place is the visible tangible layer.

The spirit of a place **constructs tangible characteristics**, at the same time as the **physical place affects and structures the spirit**. Places are influenced by different social actors, in terms of realisers and users who actively participate in the construction of their meanings

the architectural aspect of Genius Loci was implemented in Landscape Design in order to address the players’ sense of closeness and identity of a place achieved through human intervention, including a dialogue between the natural, the cultural, and the artificial construct.

Genius Loci”, the sacred spirit of a territory, that is analyzed according to its dimensions in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. Its constitutive elements are: 
- enchantment, 
- ambiguity, 
- bodily experience, 
- topology of the place, 
- the dialogue between the past and the present, 
- and the perceptual Gestalt.

In order to gain a existential foothold in this world, man has to be able to know WHERE he is in a space, and he also has to now HOW he fits into this spaes. He has to be able to ORIENT himself as well as being able to IDENTIFY himself in the environment.
	**Orientation**
	**Identification**

to truly to belong to a space it is vital that both psychological functions are completly established.

Kevin Lynch - The image of the city node(landmark), path, edge and district to denote the basic spatial structures which are the object of mans orientation. It is often the case that these systems of orientation are derived from a given natural structure in the locality.

The interrelashionship between mn ad his environment has become less of a utilitarian relationship and more of a symbiosis, where we are no longer so desperately relying on our environment for survival and where we are now able to work harmoniously in a constructive manner.

Environmental quality which protect mans against getting lost , is called by lynch imaginability which means that shape, colour or arrangement which facilitates the making of vividly identification , powerfully structured , highly useful mental images of the environment. Our cognition of one Place is depends on these physical and perceptual elements.(Lynch 1960)

Genius loci is an extremely complex and multidimensional concept, which involves the physical, psychological and social aspects of environment and is multi-layered(Smith et al. 1997, 233).

Sense of place and genius loci can be defined as “the collection of meanings, beliefs, symbols, values, and feelings that individuals and groups associate with a particular locality” (Williams & Stewart 1998)

Genius loci is a Roman concept , every independent have its genius and guardian spirit. This spirit gives life to people and places, accompanies them from birth to death, and determines their character or essence.(Norberg-Schulz 1980, p.18)

The concept, on the one hand, is rooted in the **subjective experiences** such as
- memories, 
- traditions, 
- history, 
- culture, 
- and society. 
It can be affected by the **objective and external effects in the environment** such as 
- design, 
- landscape, 
- smell, 
- and sound, on the other hand. 
Accordingly, sense of place is a complicated concept of the human feelings and attachment towards the environment that is produced due to the adaptation and use of place by the human. *It means that sense of place has not been a predetermined event but results from the human interaction with the environment(Falahat 2006)*

The factors which create sense of place, are divided into two categories: 
- cognitive and perceptual factors; 
- physical characteristic. 
(Steele 1981)

Perception
- Adjectives like protective, practical ,festive, solemn and etc, can describe a place character. 
- Time elements can make effects on a place character which come with seasons, day& night, weather, and light. 
- The character is determined by material and formal constitution of the place (how is the ground or how is the sky above our head or how are the boundaries which defined the place). Motifs like particular types of windows or doors and roofs may become “conventional elements”, which serve to transpose a character from one place to another. (Ibid.)
