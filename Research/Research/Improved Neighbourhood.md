what makes a design decision a good one?


#### Walkable Neighbourhoods
#### Cultural Amenities 
The question of balancing art and investment, aesthetics and consumerism will continue to plague politicians, artists and citizens all over the world. (Plaza, 2006, p. 464)

Bianchini and Landry (1995), Landry (2008) and Florida (2002) stressed the importance of cultural amenities which may increase the “quality of place”, draw high-skilled workers and subsequently boost the urban economy (Evans & Foord, 2008, p. 71).

Cultural amenities—the set of institutions (public and private) which enable the “local” consumption or provision of services with a high semiotic or aesthetic value such as museums, galleries, zoos, theatres, festivals and sport venues—are then important for contemporary urban economies (Clark & Kahn, 1988, p. 363; Evans, 2009, p. 1008; Scott, 2004, p. 462)

e. Cultural planning, to use a rather recent definition, is “... the strategic and integrated planning and use of cultural resources in urban and community development” (Mercer, 2006, p. 6)

~ Cultural amenities together with shops, cafe´s and restaurants created not only a particular atmosphere of urbanity, diversity, excitement and tolerance for innovative or creative workers (van Aalst, 1997; Florida, 2002; Helbrecht & Dirksmeier, 2012), but also provided the setting for the exchange of (tacit) knowledge in meaningful face-to-face encounters: “Art museums, boutiques, restaurants, and other specialized sites of consumption create a social space for the exchange on which business thrive” (Zukin, 1995, p. 13)

Quality of place and especially culture has become, consequently, more and more an issue in urban planning (Trip, 2007).

Cultural amenities encompass a large variety of activities. They comprise, as said, museums, theatres, galleries, zoos, sports venues, festivals and other activities that enable local consumption of assorted cultural services.

As Dowling (1997, p. 30) observed already more than a decade ago: “Putting culture on the urban planning agenda ... has been crucial in illustrating the centrality of culture in everyday life.”

Regeneration of neighbourhoods, putting a city on the (tourist) map, and, more recently, attracting high-skilled workers and, more fanciful, luring members of the creative class by offering a high quality of place with a wide range of cultural amenities have become the key aims to which investing in culture is seen to contribute.

As von Eckardt from the American perspective, put it: “Cultural planning does not imply any attempt to plan culture, it is the attempt to nurture and cultivate cultural activity so that the arts can grow with vigor and yield abundant fruit. Properly planned [it] will include all the arts, which can yield economic benefits, as well as enjoyment and inspiration for everyone” (1982, pp. 15– 16).

Today, the idea of the “Art of City Making” (Landry, 2006) attempts to draw on both of these aspects of cultural planning and planning for culture, with culture now seen as a fourth pillar of sustainability and governance (Barnett, 1999; Bennett, 1995), as well as a component of local amenity and quality of life (Hawkes, 2001). This sentiment is reflected in the approach to cultural planning undertaken as part of community development, local heritage and neighbourhood regeneration projects (Bianchini & Ghilardi, 2004; Guppy, 1997).
