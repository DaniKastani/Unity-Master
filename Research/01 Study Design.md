HYPOTHESES 

Integrating game inspired navigation tools like map-based systems, markers and compasses, when communicating spatial information about the neighborhood, will significantly enhance the user's spatial orientation, understanding, and ability to make well-informed design decisions for urban planning compared to an immersive virtual environment using only a map-based approach.

##### Questionnaire 
Name, age, gender, experience with VR

How confident do you feel in your ability to navigate and orient yourself within a virtual environment?

##### Explanation of Study
- What is it about.
- What are NEBourhood HUbs
- What is expected of the participant
	- orient themselves, keep the task of design in mind
- take in the [[03 Environment]], get to know it

#### Exploring the virtual environment
depending on the design choices maybe 3 different environments
- Map
- Compass
- Landmarks/Icons in FOV

## ==Orientation of the Environment==

**measuring orientation and understanding of the given space**

How confident do you feel in your ability to navigate and orient yourself within the virtual environment?

##### Potential Questions
- I feel well informed about the landmarks/activities related to trade/leisure activities within the environment.
- I feel well informed about about the environmental factors? (trades and leisure activities) that can impact my design decision.
- I feel well prepared to incorporate the information gathered into my decision making.

##### [[Cognitive Mapping]]
Participant get a map where they have to mark the location of the landmark.

Depending of the environment they have been in, the map is either a detailed map of the environment or just the approximate distance of the place the user has been in.
