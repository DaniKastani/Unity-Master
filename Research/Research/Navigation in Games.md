Creating successful 3-D games is a hard task. Such games should lead the player through the environment, establish a good method for telling the player what to do, and challenge the player at the same time. All these design requirements are directly or indirectly related to navigation. Thus, navigation is one of the most important and essential systems in the design of 3-D games [Nerurkar 2009; Rogers 2009; Rollings and Adams 2003; Taylor 2009]

it is crucial to support players’ navigation to assist players’ progress in games. t navigation in games is a complex process that is related to different aspects of the game

The study of navigation in both real environments and 3-D games is an elusive topic involving studies in architecture, lighting, orientation, and signage, to mention a few. Previous studies in game navigation have discussed how architectural design may interfere with a participant’s progress and experience

In his view, navigational aids guide players by inviting them to keep moving through the environment. Rogers [2009]

Taylor [2009] states that for some games (e.g., Mirror’s Edge - EA, 2008) navigation is the most important interaction element. In his lecture, he outlines some navigational aids and categorizes them as explicit or implicit. Examples of explicit navigational aids include: objectives, compass, signposts and spoken directions, which are used to push the player. On the other hand, examples of implicit navigational aids are: landmarks, lighting, AI encounters, pick-ups and contrast, which are used to pull the player.

Nerurkar [2009] identified a list of 14 elements used in games to guide players’ paths:  Examples of discrete tools are maps, markers (elements that highlight an object), and compasses.

As explained previously, navigational aids are included in game environments when a game is too complex to enable navigation and interaction without extra information. - navigational aids: directional signs, identification signs, and orientation signs

map: This tool is a 2-D representation that shows the 3-D world from a top-down view. Such representation can be accessed through the game menu. : Maps present a total or partial visualization of the game environment. Maps [in the menu] work as directional signs when they indicate the player’s position, goals or interesting locations, and the path the player should take to reach those goals or locations. For example, some maps display locations alone, others give the character’s position, others allow the player to quickly travel from one place to another, others allow the player to set a location and a path will be drawn connecting the character’s position and the said location, and so on. 

This pattern is useful if the game has large environments or if it is an open world. It helps the player to make sense of the environmental layout and memorize locations, especially because players can take time to study the map without being at risk in the game. We want to clarify that designers should take into account the level of abstraction they want for the maps. Note that the higher the level of abstraction, the harder it is for users to make sense of the game environment. A disadvantage of this tool is that players have to interrupt the game to check the map, and that can harm the overall experience of the game.

Markers: are high-contrast elements within the game used to bring objects and locations to players’ attention. Usage: These visual compositional elements work as directional signs when the highcontrast object or spot indicates a path to the player. For example, some games present glowing arrows that can easily be seen in the environment (See Figure 3, left). Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (Figure 3, right) has drastically changed the way contrast is applied to platforms in the game environment.

Since markers clearly highlight important locations and objects, they can easily guide the player. They are part of what can be called a “game language” since expert players have no problem in interpreting what this design technique means. Besides, markers attract players’ attention to part of the scene, helping them with their goals. A drawback of using this feature is that, if not well applied, the player can feel it gives too much guidance.

Compass: Definition: A compass is a device that that points the player toward a direction without giving him/her details about the path that should be followed. Usage: This directional sign is normally used in FPS games but action-adventure games make use of this design technique as well. Usually the compass is placed on the HUD.

Benefits and drawbacks: It is appropriate to use a compass if the designer wants to guide the player but not give him all the information necessary to reach each mission. If the game environment is large enough to need a navigational aid, but not large enough for a GPS or something more straightforward, a compass might be a good option. As a drawback, a compass is usually permanently on the HUD, which may impair visibility and break the suspension of disbelief. Also, the game world should be well planned; otherwise, the compass will not satisfy the needs of the player.

Maps are very often used in video games as a representation of a fictional geographical space [[8]
Thanks to the basic content and the cartographic elements used, players can obtain spatial information about current events in the virtual world [[9]
Maps play an important role in common navigation both in video games and in real life by helping the user find their way and get directly from A to B [[15]
As video games evolve, game developers are implementing newer and newer cartographic elements such as mini-maps, compasses, arrows, cartographic symbols and others to better understand space [[18]

Landmark knowledge involves remembering specific objects or settings in an environment – such as a statue or a building in a city centre

From subtle signs or arrows, to obvious glowing trails, many games feature navigational aids or assistance. Two common navigational assists are compasses and mini-maps [38].
An example is the quest marker [38,54] – icons that indicate the start, end, or intermediate goal of a quest. For example, Skyrim [5] (Figure 1) includes a compass at the top of the screen with markers for selected quests and icons for points of interest.

This work provides new evidence that navigation assistance is a valuable tool to help novices deal with the complexities of 3D games, and that incidental learning of 3D game environments can occur, even with strong assistance.

the ability to read and comprehend graphical representations is always the starting point of understanding space, interaction within and with a space is the means by which space is best understood.

Navigable space is space through which one must find one’s way around, as opposed to a space in which one need not move, or a space in which one’s movement is largely predetermined or so severely limited that one does not have the possibility of getting lost. Navigation is more than merely getting from one place to another; it is a cyclical process which involves exploration, the forming of a cognitive map of how spaces are connected, which in turn aids the decision-making processes employed by the player to move through those spaces for further exploration.

However, successful player navigation is crucial for a compelling player experience [14]. Thus, it is a challenging task for VR game designers to deal with the trade-off between overburdening the player and hampering immersion.


The highest premise for all design decisions should be not to infringe the player’s feeling of autonomy and to protect cognitive immersion.

compiled a comprehensive collection of 27 design patterns, which address the identified navigational problems1 . These patterns are based on findings from perception psychology, cognitive psychology, environmental design, game and level design, as well as an analysis of VR and non-VR games. 
elements and techniques, which allow to guide the player without being too restrictive and are easy to integrate without much development effort


[https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2017.1418804](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1080/10447318.2017.1418804)

Players in computer games continue to rely on assistance for navigation in the game environment, even after hours of gameplay. 
The use of such aids in computer games is necessitated by the demands of immersion and entertainment and, hence, they cannot be entirely discarded.
This behavior is in contrast to the real world where spatial knowledge of an unfamiliar environment develops with experience and reliance on navigational assistance declines.

Many video games are based on real-world concepts to represent virtual geographical space and present a series of phenomena linked by spatial information [[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/12/2/58#B3-ijgi-12-00058)]

non-diegetic design: 
.The non-diegetic UI design is everything that is not in the game world or story, nor interactable by the characters in it. Most menus and game displays consist of multiple non-diegetic UI elements such as health bars, helpful text pop ups, ammo and item displays and a map or a compass. Combination of said elements creates the Heads-up display UI. Most heads-up displays are non-diegetic, with some sci-fi and flight games being an exception. The choice and placement of the non-diegetic UI elements are game sensitive, and some games use this to their advantage to play against the common elements, but the ones in this study are all consistent to the genre


Spatial UI is something that is in the game space, but not in the game story, for example a hovering interaction pop up, or a visual pathfinding line. These can streamline the gameplay a lot, especially for more inexperienced players that may not have the “game-sense” to know what they can interact with, or where they should go. The spatial UI designs can give a lot of gameplay specific, or story information in the 3D plane of the game. Spatial UI:s weakness is that it being a more of a game-like UI element, the players immersion might not be achieved as easily. The overuse of helpful spatial UI elements may create backlash from the more experienced gamers, for the design holding the players hand too much. For the same reason, the game designers have started including options to turn certain HUD or UI elements off in the recent years.

UI easily understandable and the player can instantly figure out when they are interacting with the UI., the UI becomes intuitive. thus the interaction with the UI can convey information more clearly.

Spatial UI design is often highly useful for gameplay purposes and can be applied to bypass some possible negative reactions caused by a shortage of information. Their inclusion can help new players to recognize what elements they can interact with, or which way to go.

According to Lidwell, Holden & Butler (2010), the act of navigation can be broken down into four stages:
**Orientation** is the act of determining one’s current location, this is done by attempting to locate nearby familiar landmarks.
**Route decision** is the selection of a specific route, determined by one’s desired destination and the routes available at a given location
**Route monitoring**.It is imperative to constantly check whether the desired route is being followed correctly. This is usually accomplished by examining the environment for expected landmarks, if a visible path is not available.
**Destination recognition.** Concluding that a destination has been reached is again generally done by encountering an expected landmark associated with the destination.
