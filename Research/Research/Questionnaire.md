Qualitative findings may be presented alone or in combination with quantitative data. Research and evaluation studies employing multiple methods, including combinations of qualitative and quantitative data, are common. At the simplest level, a questionnaire or interview that asks both fixed-choice (closed) questions and open-ended questions is an example of how quantitative measurement and qualitative inquiry are often combined


**open-ended:** - RECALL QUESTION
**→ make the participant recall what they can remember**
→ Capturing Depth and Unprompted Recall

Open-ended questions allow participants to freely recall and describe the amenities they remember without any prompts or suggestions. This is crucial for understanding what stands out most to participants after using the orientation tools and which elements of the environment are most memorable.

By letting participants describe amenities in their own words, you gain insight into their depth of understanding. This can reveal not only whether they remember specific amenities but also how they perceive and interpret them, including any nuances or details that might not be captured in a multiple-choice format.

Open-ended questions and probes yield in-depth responses about people’s experiences, perceptions, opinions, feelings, and knowledge

open-ended questions that offer the persons being interviewed the opportunity to respond in their own words and to express their own personal perspectives

------

open-ended questions allow the respondent to express an opinion without being influenced by the researcher (Foddy, 1993: 127)

advantages of the open-ended questions include the possibility of discovering the responses that individuals give spontaneously, and thus avoiding the bias that may result from suggesting responses to individuals, a bias which may occur in the case of close-ended questions.

Lazarsfeld (1944: 38-60) already suggested using open-ended questions at the initial stage of questionnaire design in order to identify adequate answer categories for the close-ended questions. In the later stages of the questionnaire design, open-ended questions can be used to explore deviant
responses to the close-ended questions.

to avoid the bias that may result from suggesting responses to individuals.

open-ended questions produce more missing data than close-ended

**Auswertung** 

- **Frequency Analysis:** Count how often each element is recalled across all participants. This gives you an idea of which elements were most and least memorable.
- **Recall Accuracy:** If you have a list of all possible elements in the VR environment, you can measure how accurately participants recalled these elements by comparing their responses to the list.
- **Recall Rate:** Calculate the proportion of correctly recalled elements out of the total possible elements for each participant.


---------------------------------------------------

**close-ended Questions:** - RECOGINTION QUESTOIN
**→ find out how well participants can identify and recognize previously encountered information**
→ Ensuring Coverage and Measuring Specific Recognition

Multiple-choice questions are effective for measuring whether participants can recognize or recall specific amenities when presented with options. This allows you to quantitatively assess which amenities are more likely to be remembered after using the orientation tools.

-------
Close-ended questions limit the respondent to the set of alternatives being offered (Foddy, 1993: 127)


close-ended questions in general yield higher percentages than open-ended question for answers that are identical in both question forms. It seems that respondents restricted themselves with apparent ease to the alternatives offered on the close-ended forms, whereas on the open-ended question they produced a much more diverse set of answers.

- **Descriptive Statistics:**
    - **Mean Score:** Calculate the average score across all participants to understand the overall recall performance.
    - **Median and Mode:** Determine the median and mode to assess the central tendency.
    - **Standard Deviation:** Calculate the standard deviation to understand the variability in recall performance among participants.
- **Item Analysis:**
    - **Item Difficulty:** Calculate the difficulty of each question by finding the proportion of participants who answered it correctly. A higher proportion indicates an easier question.
    - **Item Discrimination:** Assess how well each question differentiates between high-performing and low-performing participants. This can be done by comparing how often top scorers and low scorers answered the question correctly.
- **Response Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of responses for each question to see if there are any patterns, such as common distractors (incorrect options that were frequently chosen).





Spatial Understanding:
**→ understand how well the participants remember the spatial environment and the service infrastructure**
