Map reading (cartography, maps, and street plans) and wayfinding (pedestrian navigation in the real world) are activities related to the skill of spatial orientation (Gonzato and Godino 2011; Irmischer and Clarke 2018).

 Spatial orientation, or the ability to physically and/or mentally orient in space, is considered to be one of the main categories of spatial skills (Tartre 1990a, 1990b; Bodner and Guay 1997)
Disciplines related to geography, such as engineering, architecture, geoscience, urban planning, and geomatics, make use of geospatial information, where the spatial orientation skill is needed and enables them to work more efficiently (Kastens and Ishikawa 2006).

- Pokemon Go
	- The game requires use of two activities related to spatial orientation: map reading and navigation (defined as the movement from a start location to a destination in a real environment (Montello 2005). While navigating, players need to be aware of their location, and, in order to avoid getting lost, must continually orient themselves while moving toward their destination (Farr et al. 2012).
	- In the present research, students who played Pokemon GO performed better on the spatial orientation skill than those who did not play. 
	- According to this affirmation, playing Pokemon GO could develop students’ spatial ori- entation ability in the same way as formal teaching courses specifically designed for the development of spatial orientation. 


The spatial orientation skill is defined as “the ability to self-orientate relative to the environment and the awareness of self-location” (Reber 1985, 276), or “the ability to orientate physically or mentally in space” (Maier 1996, 65).

External references in the environment (landmarks) play a prominent role in wayfinding and localization processes (Raubal and Winter 2002), and provide a confirmation of the route during pedestrian navigation (Sorrows and Hirtle 1999)
In survey learning, one’s orientation in an environment can be perceived through north-up alignment (Shelton and Gabrieli 2002, 2004) or alignment with observable landmarks in the environment, such as landforms or buildings. 

As Kiefer, Giannopoulos, and Raubal (2014) claim, while wayfinding, self-location and spatial orientation are two crucial tasks. In survey learning or map- reading tasks, the perception of orientation is the north of a map or alignments with existing elements. 
At the same time, in wayfinding, navigating, or route-based learning tasks, one’s orientation can be perceived through the objects in the environment while in movement
