A wide range of globally relevant long-term changes along with sectorspecific
drivers are transforming the mobility system. They reshape
the context in which mobility takes place. One of the main drivers is a
continuing increase in global mobility demand, while global emissions need
to be drastically reduced. While human-made carbonisation levels require
concentrated action, mobility still holds one of the largest shares. The
mobility landscape is thus one of the places to bring forward significant
change when it comes to sustainability

In the current transport system, mobility hubs are commonly seen as
physical places that connect a variety of transport modes. A mobility
hub can be anything from a bus stop and a bike sharing station to
an inner-city main train station.

Mobility hubs need to enablethe physical co-location of modes. A functioning mobility hub needs to provide a variety of modal options and act as an interchange between these modes. It needs to effectively integrate in existing, planned and future transport systems, and cater to various and changing user needs. Mobility hubs are the places where different transport modes and services meet, so that people and goods have access to mobility solutions and a seamless journey.


## A functioning mobility hub of the future will need to:
• Attract users to transition from private vehicles to more effective forms
of transport, more environmentally-friendly mobility behaviour
• Effectively and conveniently move people from one place to another
• Serve users the right mobility at the right time and facilitate seamless
travel
• Be integrated into the existing transport system
• Be planned as part of larger mobility and urban development strategies
• Be able to adapt to changing needs and conditions
• Use transport infrastructure and (public) space effectively
• Become a public space and provide access without the need for
consumption – a “third” place within the neighbourhood
• Be human-scaled and offer a sense of place and community

## A framework
A modular and standardised approach to the design of the mobility hub
enables the development of highly location-specific solutions, based on fast
implementation, flexibility and adaptability.
should be designed as a third place, a place that acts as an anchor for community life and that provides spaces that encourage interaction and informal encounters, easily accessible for everyone.
The mobility hub framework and its programming are based on the idea of
mobility and service elements complimenting each other

In order to choose the appropriate modules and location of the hub, we start with an analysis of the context. What are the external drivers, local needs and preconditions? This analysis encompasses mobility and general urban planning considerations.

## Catalogue of Elements
The catalogue of elements serves as a baseline for the mobility hub
development. The catalogue is divided in two parts: mobility and service
elements. As part of this, the mobility elements serve as the foundation
for each hub, while the service elements support the mobility functions of
the hub.
This necessity to develop mobility and service elements together are a
fundamental part of the framework. While the mobility elements provide the
necessary means, and are an enabler for sustainable mobility, the service
elements can act as an anchor and draw users to the hub, and the use
of the provided mobility options. The service elements support the hub’s
ambition to become a destination and fill in the missing pieces within the
development area.

### foundation elements
The foundation elements constitute the mobility related services necessary for a functioning mobility hub. These elements form the foundation of each mobility hub, providing users with the mobility solution at any time. They are chosen depending on the mobility modes each hub aims to cover.

	bike repair
	bike sharing
	car-sharing
	charging
	information
	micro mobility
	parking 
	waiting/shelter

### supporting elements
The supporting elements provide additional, non-mobility, services to the users of the mobility hub. They are more than a commercial-add on, but are necessary to make the mobility hub work. The supporting elements make it easier and more convenient to choose sustainable mobility options, while contributing to the public realm quality in and around the hub.
