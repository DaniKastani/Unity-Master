Recollection is a relatively slow process that consists of retrieving specific details associated with the prior presentation of an item, whereas familiarity is a relatively fast process that allows one to appreciate the fact that the item was previously encountered even though no contextual detail can be retrieved. The other view— signal-detection theory—holds that recognition decisions are based on the strength of a memory signal in relation to a decision criterion. The prototypical version of signal-detection theory involves two equal-variance Gaussian distributions (one representing targets and the other representing lures) and one decision criterion.

signal-detection theory is much more viable than alternative theories that currently guide investigations into the brain basis of recognition memory, such as the DPSD model and the theory that remember– know judgments capture recollection and familiarity-
