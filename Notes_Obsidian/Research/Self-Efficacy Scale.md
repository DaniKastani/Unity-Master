Perceived self-efficacy is concerned with people’s beliefs in their capabilities to produce given attainments-
There is no all-purpose measure of perceived self-efficacy.
Scales of perceived self-efficacy must be tailored to the particular domain of functioning that is the object of interest.

Efficacy items should accurately reflect the construct. Self-efficacy is concerned with perceived capability. The items should be phrased in terms of can do rather than will do. Can is a judgment of capability; will is a statement of intention
Perceived self-efficacy should also be distinguished from other constructs such as self-esteem, locus of control, and outcome expectancies. Perceived efficacy is a judgment of capability

Another important distinction concerns performance outcome expectations. Perceived self-efficacy is a judgment of capability to execute given types of performances; outcome expectations are judgments about the outcomes that are likely to flow from such performances.

Perceived efficacy plays a key role in human functioning because it affects behavior not only directly, but by its impact on other determinants such as goals and aspirations, outcome expectations, affective proclivities, and perception of impediments and opportunities in the social environment (Bandura, 1995, 1997)

The efficacy scales must be linked to factors that, in fact, determine quality of functioning in the domain of interest.

In the standard methodology for measuring self-efficacy beliefs, individuals are presented with items portraying different levels of task demands, and they rate the strength of their belief in their ability to execute the requisite activities. They record the strength of their efficacy beliefs on a 100-point scale, ranging in 10-unit intervals from 0 (“Cannot do”); through intermediate degrees of assurance, 50 (“Moderately certain can do”); to complete assurance, 100 (“Highly certain can do”)

A practice item, such as the capability to lift objects of increasing weight, helps to familiarize respondents with the scale gauging strength of efficacy belief and reveals any misunderstanding about how to use it.

Self-efficacy judgments are recorded privately without personal identification to reduce social evaluative concerns. The self-efficacy scale is identified by code number rather than by name. Respondents are informed that their responses will remain confidential and be used only with number codes by the research staff. If the scale is labeled, use a nondescript title such as “Appraisal Inventory” rather than Self-Efficacy
