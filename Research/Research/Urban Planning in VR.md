Virtual Reality (VR) devices such as 3D-rendering headsets and smartphones have become accessible to a broad audience, increasing their potential utility beyond specialist settings. Thanks to their immersive nature, VR headsets can provide a tool for supporting decision-making processes in architecture and urban planning, by virtually placing the observer in the context of the design. 3D rendering in such processes has evolved from expert systems to participatory systems, in which the public is given the opportunity to experience the envisioned design through an immersive visualization [9,20,39,40].

Experimental research suggests that VR can increase public participation in such processes [9,17] and provide a sufficiently realistic experience to make judgements on the quality of the presented content, instead of paying attention to rendering artifacts.

Visual communication can effectively support processes of collective decision-making and communicating about such decisions. It can offer a common language in an easily accessible medium and thus reduce barriers for public engagement, allowing participants to become more literate about planning processes.

VR has been demonstrated a suitable means, technologically, to facilitate public participation in urban decision-making [20]

The present technology of smartphones allows for sufficiently realistic VR experiences, making the technology suitable for largescale participatory design and assessment of design proposals [5,22,27]. Experimental applications have suggested that VR and interactive 3D visualizations on mobile devices help improve citizens’ understanding and increase public engagement [17].

Immersive VR has been suggested to be beneficial for recalling items seen during the virtual experience, especially in multisensory VR environments


First, immersive VR provides higher engagement than using 2D presentation technologies, indicating stronger potential in eliciting participation. 

Second, immersive VR results in more vivid memory of the viewed content than computer monitors, which may be important in terms of making informed decisions

!! Presenting additional information about plannings to the public improves transparency and lets citizens have a look into the decision process of urban planners and decision makers. This process is often very complex and requires expert knowledge. For a successful presentation a good preparation is necessary in order to present information in a way comprehensible for people with no background in urban planning.

the use of these computer-based visualization techniques could be an important contribution to the evolution of participatory planning and design, progressing toward the art of designing with people

digital technology provided a common language for all participants. The tools helped empower residents to plan and design for the future of their community

Visual representations of the real world have always offered a better route to communication and understanding than mere description.
3D technology a very powerful medium for the communication of planning issues and related knowledge exchange.
VR as a two-way communication tool offers considerable potential particularly in the area of Public Participation GIS
Therefore, distributed virtual reality environments have great potential to contribute to enabling stakeholder participation and mutual learning in the planning context.

Participatory planning is an important tool to strengthen the legitimacy of the policy and the decision making - europe2020 Participatory planning is an important tool to strengthen the legitimacy of the policy and the decision making
To make this possible, decisions and design choices should be accepted and tested by the different participants of the community, stakeholders, experts and even non-experts, as ordinary citizens.
 modern multisensory IVR technologies can successfully represent a smart and innovative tool for enhancing the participatory planning, predicting the impact on community and their complex environment.
!!! . This would suggest that acoustically and visually the immersive virtual reconstruction allowed participants to feel as in a real world. This is fully consistent with the feeling of “sense of presence” (Slater, 2009). In other words, the virtual world is perceived as a plausible world where actions, movement and perception can be correctly directed towards the complexity of the environment !!!!!
