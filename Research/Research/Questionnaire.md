The process of spatial cognition has three main phases: (1) obtaining the information of the surrounding environment; (2) capturing the morphological characteristics of space through various sensory organs; (3) storing the acquired information in brain, generating the understanding of the environment and constructing a cognitive map

Your choice of using open-ended recall questions, multiple-choice questions, and a spatial recall test is well-aligned with your study goals. These methods allow you to assess not only the accuracy of participants' memories but also the depth of their understanding and their spatial awareness within the VR environment

Qualitative findings may be presented alone or in combination with quantitative data. Research and evaluation studies employing multiple methods, including combinations of qualitative and quantitative data, are common. At the simplest level, a questionnaire or interview that asks both fixed-choice (closed) questions and open-ended questions is an example of how quantitative measurement and qualitative inquiry are often combined

**open-ended:** - RECALL QUESTION
**→ make the participant recall what they can remember**
→ Capturing Depth and Unprompted Recall

Open-ended questions allow participants to freely recall and describe the amenities they remember without any prompts or suggestions. This is crucial for understanding what stands out most to participants after using the orientation tools and which elements of the environment are most memorable.

By letting participants describe amenities in their own words, you gain insight into their depth of understanding. This can reveal not only whether they remember specific amenities but also how they perceive and interpret them, including any nuances or details that might not be captured in a multiple-choice format.

Open-ended questions and probes yield in-depth responses about people’s experiences, perceptions, opinions, feelings, and knowledge

open-ended questions that offer the persons being interviewed the opportunity to respond in their own words and to express their own personal perspectives

open-ended questions allow the respondent to express an opinion without being influenced by the researcher (Foddy, 1993: 127)

advantages of the open-ended questions include the possibility of discovering the responses that individuals give spontaneously, and thus avoiding the bias that may result from suggesting responses to individuals, a bias which may occur in the case of close-ended questions.

Lazarsfeld (1944: 38-60) already suggested using open-ended questions at the initial stage of questionnaire design in order to identify adequate answer categories for the close-ended questions. In the later stages of the questionnaire design, open-ended questions can be used to explore deviant
responses to the close-ended questions.

open-ended questions produce more missing data than close-ended

Multiple-choice questions are effective for testing specific recognition of amenities in the VR environment. They help determine whether participants can identify the correct amenities when provided with options, thus measuring the accuracy of their memory and understanding



---------------------------------------------------

**close-ended Questions:** - RECOGINTION QUESTOIN
**→ find out how well participants can identify and recognize previously encountered information**
→ Ensuring Coverage and Measuring Specific Recognition

Multiple-choice questions are effective for measuring whether participants can recognize or recall specific amenities when presented with options. This allows you to quantitatively assess which amenities are more likely to be remembered after using the orientation tools.

Close-ended questions limit the respondent to the set of alternatives being offered (Foddy, 1993: 127)


close-ended questions in general yield higher percentages than open-ended question for answers that are identical in both question forms. It seems that respondents restricted themselves with apparent ease to the alternatives offered on the close-ended forms, whereas on the open-ended question they produced a much more diverse set of answers.

**Auswertung** 

For open-ended question
- **Frequency Analysis:** Count how often each element is recalled across all participants. This gives you an idea of which elements were most and least memorable. - for each category and overall

- **Recall Accuracy:** If you have a list of all possible elements in the VR environment, you can measure how accurately participants recalled these elements by comparing their responses to the list.

- **Recall Rate:** Calculate the proportion of correctly recalled elements out of the total possible elements for each participant.

for both
- **Descriptive Statistics:**
    - **Mean Score:** Calculate the average score across all participants to understand the overall recall performance.
    - **Median and Mode:** Determine the median and mode to assess the central tendency.
    - **Standard Deviation:** Calculate the standard deviation to understand the variability in recall performance among participants.

For multiple choice 
- **Item Analysis:**
    - **Item Difficulty:** Calculate the difficulty of each question by finding the proportion of participants who answered it correctly. A higher proportion indicates an easier question.
    - **Item Discrimination:** Assess how well each question differentiates between high-performing and low-performing participants. This can be done by comparing how often top scorers and low scorers answered the question correctly.
- **Response Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of responses for each question to see if there are any patterns, such as common distractors (incorrect options that were frequently chosen).

Spatial Understanding:
**→ understand how well the participants remember the spatial environment and the service infrastructure**

At its most general, a cognitive map is a mental construct which we use to understand and know the environment (Kaplan, 1973a). The term assumes that people store information about their environment which they then use to make spatial decisions

Cognitive mapping is the process of encoding, storing, and manipulating experienced and sensed geo-referenced information. 

The degrees of knowledge about places, locations, or landmarks or other components of a route vary among people (i.e., there are individual differences in the nature and extent of environmental knowledge).

cognitive map is generally used to describe the mental representations that people form of their spatial environment.

Spatial recall tests provide insights into participants' ability to navigate and understand the VR space, which is a key aspect of evaluating the overall effectiveness of the orientation tools in enhancing spatial awareness and environmental comprehension.

According to Kulpers (1983), the cognitive map is the body of knowledge of a large-scale environment which is acquired by integrating observations over time. It can be used to find routes and determine the relative position of places
