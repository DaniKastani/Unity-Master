Generally, spatial ability has been defined as 
- “the ability to generate, retain, retrieve, and transform well-structured visual images” (Lohman, 1994); 
- the ability to manipulate visual images mentally (Burnett, Lane, & Dratt, 1979)
- and the ability to create “a mental representation of a two or three-dimensional structure and then assessing its properties or performing a transfor- mation of the representation” (Carpenter & Just, 1986, p. 221).

User’s perceptual understanding of the environment is more accurate in virtual reality, and agrees with established quantitative measures of visibility, accessibility, and organization of space.

There is evidence that people using head mounted displays may underestimate distance depending on measurement protocol [Grechkin et al . 2010].

Human spatial cognition and architectural attributes are the two main aspects which govern behaviour in an environment [Hölscher et al. 2005]. The effects of an environment on its users can be quantified by using measures from spatial analysis which directly relate to human behaviours.
A well established static approach used for spatial analysis is Space- Syntax [Bafna 2003; Hillier and Hanson 1984].

It appears that novices may gain a significantly better understanding of a potential design if they are allowed to experience it using VR. Intuitively, this means personal experience with a design is useful in communicating attributes of the space. Though virtual reality is not reality, it provides an ad-hoc, yet immersive, means of approximating a person’s experience without the need to be physically in the space.  
- Lastly, the work does not test how different navigation modes might affect visual perception of the environment.

Design understanding and needed level of the accompanying spatial skills that enable it depend on information input provided by a visual representation of a design solution.


Spatial information contained in visual representations concerns spatial properties of visual stimuli (presented objects and environments) [21]. 
This information includes properties of the objects and environments (for example size, shape, and scale), and relations among elements of the objects themselves and other objects in the environment (some examples are distance, direction, orientation, and location.

To perceive the spatial information, the mental representation of a three-dimensional model of its spatial layout has to be made [22]. The three-dimensional mental model is created by the perceptual system using visual cues (such as binocular disparity and stereopsis) and internalized assumptions about the environment based on past experiences [23].

Visual representations are often divided into allocentric (objective) and egocentric (body-relative) [7], [26]. Conventional monitor display mediates an allocentric representation of a VE; it is independent of the user and does not refer to the user or any part of its body [26].
Furthermore, the two-dimensional nature of the conventional monitor display is its limitation [27], which is diminishing fidelity of representation and efficiency of its usage

VR mediates an egocentric representation of a VE, which is often referred to as an IVE; one in which a user is perceptually surrounded by the VE [20].

Engineering students more accurately perceive spatial properties in the IVE than nIVE. On the other hand, it is suggested that the likelihood of making the correct judgment of the affordance is similar in both VEs.
Spatial perception as an aspect of a design understanding differs between the egocentric and allocentric visual representations in extrinsic, but not in the intrinsic tasks. 
	 visual perception of intrinsic (such as orientation ([[Spatial Orientation]]) and arrangement of parts, size, rotation, scaling) and extrinsic (for instance, location relative to other objects or a reference frame) spatial properties

It is suggested to further investigate the effects of VEs on the level of designers’ spatial skills needed for design understanding and relationships among them. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of spatial perceptions in VEs, future studies should include more spatial properties (such as shapes, orientations, or rotations of parts) and affordances (such as grasp-ability of the parts or assembling possibilities) of various design solutions.
