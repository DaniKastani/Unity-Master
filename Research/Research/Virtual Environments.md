Three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments (VEs) are an increasingly useful tool for the visualization, manipulation, and processing of information across a variety of domains such as education, science, and engineering. In VEs, information can be displayed in a graphically realistic and intuitive manner, allowing users to navigate the environ- ment using skills associated with spatial cognition (Bowman, Kruijff, LaViola, & Poupyrev, 2004)

One promising line of research shows that playing [[Videogames]] can improve spatial cognition and perception

When investigating [[Spatial Perception]] in VEs, scholars in the AEC domains often focus on spatial properties such as dimensions of objects or distances between several objects.

In architectural design, Paes et al. [24] conducted an experiment that included asking the participants to identify correct values of spatial properties (such as dimensions, proportions, and apertures) of an entrance hall of the building presented in IVE, nIVE, and physical environment. IVE-based design review led to the enhanced understanding of the spatial arrangement of the virtual model.

!! NOT VR Glasses!!!
The use of virtual reality in the area of spatial cognition raises the question of the quality of learning transfer from a virtual to a real environment.
Most of the time, exploration is seen as active if the individual can move with few constraints in the VE, and it is passive when the subject is constrained to visualize a pre-determined recorded route. 

Within the Virtual conditions, active learning markedly increased the performance (Wayfinding task) of the subjects for all indicators (i.e., errors and hesitations) compared to passive learning. Therefore, active learning in a VE may facilitate the transfer of spatial knowledge ( [[Spatial Perception]]) from virtual to real environment, as suggested by several previous studies with similar findings [e.g., Péruch et al. 1995; Christou and Bülthoff 1999; Carassa et al. 2002; Farell et al. 2003].

Peruch et al. [1995] proposed that recall of spatial layout was better in an active compared to a passive learning condition, as the subjects were able to respect perception-action coupling and to correlate motor and visual inputs.
