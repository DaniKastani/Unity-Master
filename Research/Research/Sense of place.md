Urban designers and architects play important and determining roles in defining the physical qualities and the characteristics of a place. However, it has always been challenging to quantify the relationship between a physical environment and a person’s emotional experience.

Creating a sense of place (SOP) and community is a guiding principle in designing livable and high-quality built environments.
“Place” is a complex concept that embodies a set of tangible and nontangible qualities, and literature has long theorized an emotional connection between people and places.

earliest studies on SOP were rooted in both social science and urban design.
There is a strong belief that SOP is an innate faculty possessed by everyone, which connects us to the world. It is essential to our environmental experience
each place has its own unique set of indicators
	-physical, 
	-visual, 
	-social, 
	-and economic—that define SOP

! nice phrasing ! In our proposed framework, we adopt this fundamental idea that SOP is to be investigated from physical, visual, and social angles.

 SOP is a guiding principle in designing the built environment for sustainability and liveability.
 
 **constructing and making a place is dynamic, and the effectiveness of the place depends on human perceptions of the space, social interactions, economies, cultures, and histories**.
	 **Economies, Cultures, and Histories**: It also states that place is influenced by economies, cultures, and histories, suggesting that these elements are vital to understanding the essence of place

 Currently, architects and designers concentrate on the physical environment when crafting a sense of place; understanding the influence of and the interaction between perception and placemaking could be a huge benefit to creating both effective and meaningful places.


few studies on collecting and understanding people’s perceptions of cities on a macroscale or a micro-neighborhood scale
Meanwhile, researchers from different disciplines agree that our ability to understand the effects of a city’s built environment on social and economic outcomes has been limited by the lack of quantitative data on urban perception

For professionals in the architecture and urban-design fields, what is more important than the continuation of data collection is the question of how we can interpret the data and translate it into practice.

This shows that a sense of place would often be unique and personal, perceived through one’s vision, derived from memories and experiences of the individual’s local environment.

### Sense of place in Vr
From this brief review, it is apparent that irrespective of organizing framework, methodological and philosophical differences, the components of sense of place generally comprise: 
● The physical characteristics of the environment; 
● The affect and meanings including memories and associations, as well as connotations and denotations; 
● The activities afforded by the place; 
● The social interactions associated with the place (considered by some authors as a sub class of activities).

its essentially personal nature. Most authors stress that while some generalizations are possible, the sense of place remains an emergent property of interaction between an individual and the environment, and while there are some shared elements, the experience of place is fundamentally unique to each of us. 
Place results from our experience of a space, our memories and emotional attachment to that space, and the meanings we attach to it



Sense of place does not equal presence but is a factor that influences it. we propose that the sense of place might reasonably and usefully be considered as a further content factor


However, existing place theories and empirical work lack a consideration of how people experience places that are only encountered relatively briefly, rather than being the subjects of long-established residence or long-term attachment. Such aspects of place experience are much more directly equivalent to most VR experience.

The challenge is to identify which aspects of place can best survive their translation into virtual reality given its constraints

Preliminary findings indicated that a fully immersive setup does immediately trigger a “sense of being somewhere” but would not necessarily suggest a sense of a particular place.

##### presences
The amount of presence provided by specific virtual environments is generally determined by factors of immersion and realism. The concept of presence, commonly defined as a user’s subjective sensation of “being there” [8] has been a fundamental concept for understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of virtual environments. This concept has been considered as the key to defining virtual reality in the context of human experience rather than its technological hardware




The impact of the level of immersion and realism in VE towards evoking the sense of presence could be considered as one of the most discussed topics in presence research

!!!! However, being fully immersed does not allow particular place essence to be felt without a comprehensive reconstruction of a VHE. !!!

### The Contribution of the Physical Environment to Sense of Place

Although sense of place definitions nominally include the physical environment, much research has emphasized the social construction of sense of place and neglect the potentially important contributions of the physical environment to place meanings and attachment.
Common to the rapidly proliferating definitions of sense of place is a three-component view that weaves together the physical environment, human behaviors, and social and=or psychological processes. Empirical research, however, has neglected the role of the physical environment, focusing on place meanings and attachment as products of shared behaviors and cultural processes.

As already described, places encompass the physical setting, as well as human experience and interpretation (Brandenburg and Carroll 1995; Relph 1976; Sack 1997; Tuan 1977). 

Ryden (1993, 37–38) adds that ‘‘a place ...takes in the meanings which people assign to that landscape through the process of living in it.’’ 
These authors suggest that sense of place is not intrinsic to the physical setting itself, but resides in human interpretations of the setting, which are constructed through experience with it.
Tuan suggests that an unexperienced physical setting is ‘‘blank space,’’ without important characteristics of its own: ‘‘What begins as undifferentiated space becomes place when we endow it with value’’ (Tuan 1977, 6)

environmental ambience, often described as sense of place and defined as the specific character, atmosphere, and expressive energy of a particular environment or locale

The concept genius loci, on the one hand, is rooted in the subjective experiences such as memories, traditions, history, culture, and society. It can be affected by the objective and external effects in the environment such as design, landscape, smell, and sound, on the other hand. Accordingly, sense of place is a complicated concept of the human feelings and attachment towards the environment that is produced due to the adaptation and use of place by the human. It means that sense of place has not been a predetermined event but results from the human interaction with the environment

All at once, a sense of place incorporates psychological being, social community, cultural symbols, biophysical territory, and political and economic systems.

By recognizing these interconnected dimensions, an understanding of sense of place as a multifaceted and integrated concept arises

While the social, cultural, and psychological elements are undoubtedly key, they cannot stand alone. Although social constructions are important, they hardly arise out of thin air: The local environment sets bounds and gives form to these [social] constructions Stedman (2003)
The physical setting provides the context—as some have called it, the “stage” (Basso 1996b, p. 66; Steele, 1981, p. 14

all humans first—and most directly—experience places as individuals

**Sociocultural dimensions**  are central to developing and maintaining a sense of place - —from providing a community context in which to interact with places (Hummon, 1992; U.S. EPA 2002) to creating a cultural backdrop for understanding and interpreting places

Sense of place describes the complex cognitive, affective, and evaluative relationships people develop with social and ecological communities through a variety of mechanisms. mature over an extended period within a specific environmental context, they can also occur in a shorter time period through an intense experience

Sense of place can be defined as an emotional relationship between people and places. Previous studies indicated that physical attributes, activities and meanings associated with places contribute to make sense of place.
Therefore, sense of place is a result of the interaction of human and his living space. Although long-term familiarity with place could influence the sense of place, physical attributes that encourage suitable activities and create identity can fortify the concept.
