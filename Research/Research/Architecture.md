Architectural information as spatial features are one of the key factors in planning and navigating through space. Models from architecture and urban designs are used as guidelines to improve sight, planning, and navigation in the design of virtual environments [Bridges and Charitos 1997


Environment layouts contain complex, high dimensional information which often must be communicated to decision makers that are not expert architects. Conveying such high dimensional information using low dimensional abstractions is difficult and may lead to a loss of critical information. In general, people have a difficult time comparing spatial layouts to which they cannot relate from experience [Eliot 2002; Golledge 1997]
This is of particular interest in building design which is still primarily based on 2D projections, such as blueprints, and more recently first-person views and 3D renderings with [[Videogames]]-like interfaces.

It has been shown that people better understand information supplied to them in a format more in-line with their common experience [Magana 2014; Magana et al. 2012].

Virtual reality development for architectural design and urban planning applications can be roughly grouped into two categories: applications that are used to design and display detailed 3D CAD models of architectural spaces/structures and rapid prototyping systems.
	- In the first case, the challenge has been to visualize large data sets in as photorealistic a fashion as possible. These environments are mostly used for presentation, recreation, and educational purposes  where complex 3D spaces are constructed so they can be explored in walkthroughs (Brooks, 1986; Houston, Nied- erauer, Agrawala, & Humphreys, 2004). 
	- On the other hand, the virtual prototyping environ- ments allow immersive VR to be used in earlier phases of a design process and are thus designed to incorporate a higher level of interactivity and object manipulability. In most cases, these capabilities are implemented at the expense of visual realism, as they have been developed by computer scientists in order to further advance research in VR tools

our study indicates the pertinence of our combined evaluation approach for real-world applications, and the utility of our VE in the context of an urban planning project; that both audio and visual real- ism, such as 3D sound, shadows, sun coverage, vegetation, and crowds, all contribute to better understanding of the VE and aid in the tasks at hand, and finally that VE-specific aspects such as multiple views are important
